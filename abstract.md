#### Ionide and state of F# open source environment

True open-source is more than just posting the source code on GitHub; it is defined by the community and its mentality.

During this talk I will focus on a different side of F# - the fantastic and productive software community dedicated to providing cross-platform open source tooling to make the life of every F# developer better. This presentation follows my journey - from my introduction to F# and functional programming, through learning new tools, often very different than what I was used to as C# developer, to becoming a part of an amazing community and contributing to open source projects, and finally creating my own popular project - Ionide, a suite of F# developer tools for the Atom editor and VS Code, that is built around integrating the tools created by the F# community into the development workflow.

I will shortly present tools such as Paket ( "A package dependency manager for .NET with support for NuGet packages and GitHub repositories"), FAKE (" "F# Make" is a build automation system with capabilities that extend far beyond Make and Rake."), the F# Yeoman Generator (which provides scaffolding of F# projects outside of Visual Studio), and how we have managed to integrate all of those tools with Atom in the Ionide project. I'll also go into how F# open source projects attract contributors, how they build great communities, and how they rely one on each other to foster a healthy open source ecosystem.
